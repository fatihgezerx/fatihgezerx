### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Fatih Gezer
#### Game Developer
My journey in game development began with CryEngine, briefly continued with GameMaker, and eventually found its long-term home in Unity. Along the way, I've also explored Unreal Engine. I've worked on a variety of projects in both Unity and Unreal Engine, but my preference for C# programming has led me to primarily utilize Unity. Here, I focus on developing services and assets, aiming to create valuable tools and resources for fellow developers, thereby fostering my own growth and engaging in exciting work to push my boundaries.
